# IoT-Based Project Repository

This repository contains various IoT projects and experiments developed during training at **Cranes Varsity**, focusing on real-time data processing, sensor integration, and cloud communication.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the practical implementation of IoT concepts, including:
- **Sensor Integration**: Using DHT, PIR, gas, and soil sensors to collect environmental data.
- **Data Processing**: Reading and processing sensor data in real-time.
- **Cloud Communication**: Sending processed data to the cloud for storage and analysis.
- **Output Control**: Managing outputs such as LEDs, displays (LCD), and indicators.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
1. **Sensor Data Collection**:
   - Real-time data from sensors like DHT (temperature and humidity), gas sensors, and PIR.
   - Examples include `dht.py`, `gas_sensor.py`, and `pir.py`.

2. **Cloud Communication**:
   - Script for uploading data to the cloud (`Sending_data_to_cloud.py`).
   - Demonstrates IoT-cloud integration for remote monitoring.

3. **Output Control and Display**:
   - Scripts for controlling LCDs (`lcd_api.py`, `lcd_disp.py`) and LEDs (`led.py`).

4. **Automation**:
   - Final implementations showcasing integrated solutions (`final.py`).
